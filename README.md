# Categorization-of-flowers-by-deep-learning
This model classifies the La Eterna flowers from any other types. This model uses keras in-built standardized augmentation technique involving flip, rotation, zoom and also adjusting contrast multiplying the number of images. Then a very basic model of convolutional neural networks are embedded to distinguish la eterna from others.
